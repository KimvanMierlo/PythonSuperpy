This assignment is a real step up compared to the earlier lessons. I really had to look up a lot of things from the lessons and also a google helped me a lot. There where a couple of times I really got stuck for a while, but everytime i could trace the issue in the end using common sense again google was a big help.
I think most of my time i've been busy thinking about how to solve problems from both a technical point of view, as well as from the data structure. Most of my time I've been changing the way the code works, how to store the data and how to optimize the code in readabilty and reuse of code.
That brings me to the thing that suprised and pleases me most. I thought for this project I would need a massive amount of code, but in the end I think it is really readable and very short!
The next thing I am proud of is how i solved the filtering of the data. I thought this would be really complex and it took a lot of research, but the solution I came up with is very nice I think. The if statements can easily extended with other types of filters, because they always remove data from the initial set. The other thing I which took me a while to grasp was the filter function with the lambda. At first i couldn't understand how it worked, but I could get it to do what I needed. Now I thnk I understand how it works and I really like how easy it is! Once I created the filter function I could use it for a lot of different things, and it feels as the most important function in the project.
I spent (or wasted) a lot of time on changing the 'current day'. In the end I think I came up with a creative solution: delete the file if the real date needed to be used and create or update a text file for setting the date. I also like how I can use an offset in days from now to easily change the date to any date near the current date. 
All in all I am proud of myself completing this project almost entirely by myself and it is really fun to see it in action.
